# Automatic-Basic-Temperature-Convertor
This is an automatic temperature convertor with GUI.

Language used = Python

Libraries used = Tkinter

We have to select among Celsius/Fahrenheit/Kelvin and as we enter the value it will convert the temperature to Celsius/Fahrenheit/Kelvin in REAL TIME. The GUI is made with the help of tkinter.

I wrote this code for competing in the LetsUpgrade Weekly Code Battle (Week 22) and won the challenge with this code.
